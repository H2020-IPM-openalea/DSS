def nematodes(timestart='2022-03-01', timeend='2022-08-01'):
    '''    b'THE PEST: Plant parasitic nematodes can cause serious damage to crop yield and crop quality. Important groups of plant parasitic nematodes are: cyst nematodes, root-knot nematodes, root-lesions nematodes, stem nematodes and free living nematodes. THE DECISION: Nematodes can best be managed by healthy crop rotations, as crops and crop varieties have a different host status for nematodes. Alternating host and non-host crops or varieties lowers infestation rates in the soil. THE MODEL: The model databases contain information about susceptibility and tolerance of 70 crops to 32 nematodes. The databases are neither soil-specific nor country-specific. PARAMETERS: The returns risks based on crops, including green manure crops, and crop rotation. This farm specific input has to be provided by the user. SOURCE: Created by H2020 project Best4Soil, based on the Dutch model www.aaltjesschema.nl, developed by Wageningen University and Research. ASSUMPTIONS: The model gives risk information, assuming that the user selected plant parasitic nematodes are present in the field.'
