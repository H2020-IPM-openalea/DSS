    '''    b'Sclerotinia stem rot is usually the main disease to consider during the flowering stages of oilseed rape. There are 3 main risk factors: the presence of sclerotinia inoculum (spores), warm and humid conditions, and crops in flower.\nIf spores are present and the crop is in flower, relative humidity must be above 80% and air temperatures above 7&deg;C for 23 continuous hours for the pathogen to infect the crop. This is what is predicted by the model.'
