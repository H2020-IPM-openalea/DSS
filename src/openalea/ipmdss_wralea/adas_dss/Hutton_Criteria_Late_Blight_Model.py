def Hutton_Criteria_Late_Blight_Model(p1=1001, p2=3001, timestart='2022-03-01', timeend='2022-08-01'):
    '''    b"THE PEST: Potato late blight is a disease caused by a fungus-like organism (Phytophthora infestans) that spreads rapidly in the potato crop canopy and can also infect tubers. \nTHE DECISION: The model determines when weather conditions create high risk of infection, to guide targeting of fungicide treatment. \nTHE MODEL: A high risk 'Hutton Criteria' period occurs when two consecutive days have a minimum temperature of 10\xc2\xb0C, and at least six hours of relative humidity at or above 90%. \nTHE PARAMETERS: The model uses daily air temperature and humidity \nSOURCE: James Hutton institute, UK. Introduced in the UK for the 2017 season. Dancey et al. 2017 16th Euroblight workshop. \nASSUMPTIONS: The model does not account for higher temperatures or humidity which may occur under crop covers.\n"
