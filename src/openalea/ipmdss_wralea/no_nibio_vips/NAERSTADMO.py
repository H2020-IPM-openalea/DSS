    '''    b'THE PEST: Potato late blight is caused by Phytophthora infestans, a fungus-like microorganism that causes the most devastating disease of potato. It spreads rapidly in the canopy, and can also infect tubers\nTHE DECISION: Protective fungicide treatments are needed to protect the crop when conditions for infection are favorable\nTHE MODEL: The model predicts if there are favorable conditions for spore production and the following conditions for spread, survival and infection of these spores. The model produces an infection risk, where a value of 2.5 is the threshold where a warning is issued.\nTHE PARAMETERS: The model uses temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind, radiation, leaf wetness and vapor pressure deficit as input parameters\nSOURCE: Developed by NIBIO in Norway \nASSUMPTIONS: Spores of potato late blight are present\nReference: Hjelkrem et al. 2021. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2021.109565\n'
