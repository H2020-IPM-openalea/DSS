    '''    b"THE PEST: Lettuce downy mildew (Bremia lactucae) is a disease caused by a fungus-like organism (oomycete). Symptoms are light green to yellow angular lesions, with a white mass of spores favoured by wet conditions. \nTHE DECISION: In the event of a risk alert, the potential need for fungicide sprays should be assessed based on the relevant lettuce varieties' resistance to downy mildew and the time interval from previous treatments. \n\nThe MODEL: The model indicates risk of Bremia lactucae infections in lettuce crops based on climatic conditions. Criteria for both sporulation and infection need to fulfilled before a risk period is calculated. Sporulation requires high relative humidity at night. Infection will require free moisture in the following day.  \nTHE PARAMETERS: leaf wetness, relative humidity, global radiation, maximum temperature,\nSOURCE: The model is based on studies from California, US (Scherm et al 1995, Scherm and van Bruggen, 1995, Wu et al 2002), with adaptations to fit Norwegian conditions\nREFERENCE: Nordskog, B.
