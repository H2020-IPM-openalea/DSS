def PSILAROBSE(species=['PSILRO']):
    '''    b'The warning system model is based on weekly observations of adult carrot rust flies captured on yellow sticky traps. The model is based in its entirety on observations, with no input of weather data or weather forecasts. Traps are placed in the field edge and in the field and are examined for carrot rust flies weekly throughout the season. The number of adult carrot rust flies is registered in VIPS and is used in the warning system model. The observations are compared with the economic threshold levels and a warning is calculated. After organophosphates (which had a good effect against larvae) were removed from the market, they were replaced by pyrethroids that only work against the adult stage. Studies were carried out in 2005 and 2006 to adjust the larval-based thresholds to chemical control of adult flies. The experience from Norway and other countries indicated that the first treatment against carrot rust flies should be done as soon as possible after the first fly is observed on the traps. The threshold that is used in VIPS is therefore at the first observation of 1 fly.\n\nSOURCE: \nASSUMPTIONS: \nREFERENCE: '
