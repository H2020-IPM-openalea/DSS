    '''    b'THE PEST: Septoria apiicola is the cause of late blight of celery and celeriac.  Leaf spots with characteristic small dark pycnidia form on leaves and stems. \n\nTHE DECISION: If inoculum is present, symptoms can be expected to appear 7-14 days after predicted infection risk. It is recommended to intensify field inspections after periods of risk alerts.\n\nTHE MODEL: This model is based on a calculation of how leaf wetness periods influence infection of celery by Septoria apiicola in susceptible host plants.\n\nTHE PARAMETERS: Forecasts of infection risk are given after a minimum of 12 consecutive hours of leaf wetness. \nSOURCE: The model is developed in Michigan, USA and published by Lacy, 1994.\n\nASSUMPTIONS: In Norway, the model is recommended used as a guidance for field inspections for early detection of symptoms. It is generally assumed that this model has additional relevance for Septoria petroselini in parsley.\nReference: Lacy, 1994.
